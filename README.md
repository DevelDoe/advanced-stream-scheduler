# Arcane Stream Scheduler – Overview

**Arcane Stream Scheduler** is a desktop automation tool built with Electron that simplifies and automates your livestreaming workflow. It provides a graphical interface to:

- ✅ **Schedule YouTube livestreams** via the official YouTube Data API.
- ✅ **Automatically control OBS** (Open Broadcaster Software) to:
  - Start and stop streams
  - Switch between scenes (`intro`, `live`, `end`)
- ✅ **Run on autopilot** using predefined times and routines.
- ✅ **Minimize manual intervention**, eliminating the common issue where YouTube requires manual confirmation dialogs unless the stream is pre-scheduled.

With this tool, streamers can confidently automate entire broadcast cycles, ensuring smooth, on-time, and professional stream launches — even when they’re not at the desk.
